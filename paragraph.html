      HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup
      language used to create and design web pages. It is the fundamental
      building block of web development and is used to structure content on the
      internet.
      <br />
      HTML uses a system of tags to define elements within a document,
      indicating how different parts of content should be displayed on a
      webpage.
