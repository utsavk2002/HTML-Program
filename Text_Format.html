Subject: Leave application for [date] to [date]

Dear ram,

I am writing to request a leave of absence for [number] days, from [start date] to [end date]. The reason for my leave is [reason for leave].

I have already completed all of my urgent tasks and delegated any remaining tasks to [colleague's name]. I am confident that my absence will not have a negative impact on the team's work.

I will be available by phone and email during my leave if needed. I will also check my work email regularly.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Utsav
